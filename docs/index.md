# Adapt Documentation

## Welcome to Adapt

Adapt is the easiest way to reliably and repeatedly deploy your apps anywhere -- to your laptop, a Kubernetes cluster, your favorite cloud, or anywhere else.
For more info on what Adapt is, see the [project README](../README.md).

Our documentation is a work in progress, so it may not have all the answers you're looking for yet.
If you haven't found what you need, please ask a question on our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/UnboundedSystems/Adapt) or [file an issue](https://gitlab.com/unboundedsystems/adapt/issues).
