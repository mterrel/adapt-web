## defaultDeployedWhen() function

Creates a function that implements the default `deployedWhen` behavior for an Element.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function defaultDeployedWhen(el: AdaptElement): DeployedWhenMethod;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  el | <code>AdaptElement</code> | The Element for which a default <code>deployedWhen</code> function should be created. |

<b>Returns:</b>

`DeployedWhenMethod`

A `deployedWhen` function for Element `el` that implements the default behavior.

## Remarks

When a component has not specified a custom `deployedWhen` method, it will use this function to generate the default `deployedWhen` method.

The default `deployedWhen` behavior, implemented by this function, is to return `true` (meaning the Element has reached the `goalStatus` and is deployed) once the successor Element of `el` is deployed. If `el` has no successor, it will return `true` once all of its children have become deployed.
