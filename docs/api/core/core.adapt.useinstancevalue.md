## Adapt.useInstanceValue() function

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

Get the value of field from the instance referenced by handled instance.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function useInstanceValue<T>(hand: Handle, initial: T, field: string): T;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  hand | <code>Handle</code> |  |
|  initial | <code>T</code> |  |
|  field | <code>string</code> |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

`T`

## Remarks

On first invocation, or if the handle is not associated with an element, or the field is not found, the value of `initial` will be returned. After the element referenced by handle has been instantiated, this hook will fetch the actual value of `field`<!-- -->, cause a rebuild, and then return that value on the next call of the hook.
