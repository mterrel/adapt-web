## k8s.ServiceSpec.externalIPs property

A list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service.

<b>Signature:</b>

These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes. The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP. A common example is external load balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.
