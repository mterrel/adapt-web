## ConnectToInstance interface

Components that provide a service, such as a database service or API service, can implement this interface in order to supply all the information required to connect to the service.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface ConnectToInstance 
```

## Methods

|  Method | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [connectEnv()](./cloud.connecttoinstance.connectenv.md) | Supplies the set of environment variables that have all the information needed for a consumer of a service to connect to the provider. |

## Remarks

Currently, the only method supported for providing connection information is via environment variables. However, additional formats for providing connection information will be added as needs arise.
