## k8s.ServicePort.targetPort property

Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
targetPort?: number | string;
```

## Remarks

Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA\_SVC\_NAME. If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the 'port' field is used (an identity map). This field is ignored for services with clusterIP = None, and should be omitted or set equal to the 'port' field.
