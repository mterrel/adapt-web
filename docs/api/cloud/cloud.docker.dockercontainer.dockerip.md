## docker.DockerContainer.dockerIP() method

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

Get the IP address of the container, optionally for a specific Docker network.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
dockerIP(network?: string): Promise<string | undefined>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  network | <code>string</code> | Name of a Docker network. If <code>network</code> is provided and the container is connected to the network with an IP address, that address will be returned. If the container is not connected to the network, <code>undefined</code> will be returned. If <code>network</code> is not provided, the default container IP address will be returned. |

<b>Returns:</b>

`Promise<string | undefined>`

## Remarks

The IP addresses that are returned by this function are valid only on the associated Docker network, which is often only associated with a single host node for most Docker network types.
