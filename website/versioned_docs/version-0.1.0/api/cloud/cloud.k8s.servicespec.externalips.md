## k8s.ServiceSpec.externalIPs property

externalIPs is a list of IP addresses for which nodes in the cluster will also accept traffic for this service.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
externalIPs?: string[];
```

## Remarks

These IPs are not managed by Kubernetes. The user is responsible for ensuring that traffic arrives at a node with this IP. A common example is external load-balancers that are not part of the Kubernetes system.
