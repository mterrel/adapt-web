Get the IP address of the container, optionally for a specific Docker network.

```typescript
dockerIP(network?: string): string | undefined;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  network | <code>string</code> | Name of a Docker network. If <code>network</code> is provided and the container is connected to the network with an IP address, that address will be returned. If the container is not connected to the network, <code>undefined</code> will be returned. If <code>network</code> is not provided, the default container IP address will be returned. |

The IP addresses that are returned by this function are valid only on the associated Docker network, which is often only associated with a single host node for most Docker network types.
