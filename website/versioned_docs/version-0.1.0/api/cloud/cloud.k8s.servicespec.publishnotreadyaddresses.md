## k8s.ServiceSpec.publishNotReadyAddresses property

publishNotReadyAddresses, when set to true, indicates that DNS implementations must publish the notReadyAddresses of subsets for the Endpoints associated with the Service.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
publishNotReadyAddresses?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

The default value is false. The primary use case for setting this field is to use a StatefulSet's Headless Service to propagate SRV records for its Pods without respect to their readiness for purpose of peer discovery.
