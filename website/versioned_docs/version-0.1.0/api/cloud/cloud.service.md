## Service class

An abstract component that represents a group of components that implements a service. Note that this is not necessarily a network service, but will often be.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare abstract class Service extends Component<ServiceProps, {}> 
```

## Remarks

Typical children will be [NetworkService](./cloud.networkservice.md) and [Container](./cloud.container.md) elements.
