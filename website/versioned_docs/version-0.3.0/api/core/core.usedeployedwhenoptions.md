## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [trivial](./core.usedeployedwhenoptions.trivial.md) | <code>boolean</code> | This flag is a hint for user interfaces, such as the Adapt CLI. It tells the user interface that this component's <code>deployedWhen</code> function is "trivial" and therefore its status should not typically be shown in user interfaces unless the user has requested more detailed status information on all components, or if there's an active action for the component.<code>trivial</code> should typically be set to <code>true</code> if the <code>deployedWhen</code> function \*\*only\*\* depends on the status of other components and does not have any additional conditions of its own. |
