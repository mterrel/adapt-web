Starting with the successor of `hand`<!-- -->, search for a built Element instance in the handle chain that implements method `methodName` and immediately execute it.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
callNextInstanceMethod: typeof callNextInstanceWithMethod
```

## Remarks

If `hand` is not associated with an Element, an error is thrown.

The exact check that is currently used when searching the handle chain is mounted Elements that have an instance method `methodName`<!-- -->. Because only built Elements have an Element instance, this only selects Elements that are mounted and built and will not select Elements that have been replaced by a style sheet rule.
