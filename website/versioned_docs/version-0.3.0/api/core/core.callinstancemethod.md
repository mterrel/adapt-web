## callInstanceMethod() function

> This API is provided as a preview for developers and may change based on feedback that we receive. Do not use this API in a production environment.
> 

Search for the first built Element in the handle chain of `hand` and immediately execute the instance method `methodName` on that Element's instance.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function callInstanceMethod<T = any>(hand: Handle, def: T, methodName: string, ...args: any[]): T;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  hand | [<code>Handle</code>](./core.handle.md) |  |
|  def | <code>T</code> |  |
|  methodName | <code>string</code> |  |
|  args | <code>any[]</code> |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

`T`

The return value of the called instance method if `hand` is associated and there is an Element in the handle chain that has not been replaced by a style sheet rule. Otherwise, returns the default value `def`<!-- -->.

## Remarks

If an Element is found that satisfies the search, but method `methodName` does not exist on the Element's instance, an error is thrown.

The exact check that is currently used when searching the handle chain is for mounted Elements that satisfy the predicate `notReplacedByStyle`<!-- -->. In practice, this only selects Elements that are both mounted and built.
