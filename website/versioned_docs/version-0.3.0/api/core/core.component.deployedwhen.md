## Component.deployedWhen property

A derived component's custom `deployedWhen` method.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
deployedWhen?: DeployedWhenMethod;
```

## Remarks

Adding a custom `deployedWhen` method to a component allows the component to directly control when the component can be considered deployed.

For more information on using `deployedWhen` methods, see [Adapt.DeployedWhenMethod](./core.adapt.deployedwhenmethod.md)<!-- -->.

For components that do not add a custom `deployedWhen` method, the default behavior is that a component becomes deployed when all of it's successors and children have been deployed. See [defaultDeployedWhen()](./core.defaultdeployedwhen.md) for more information.
