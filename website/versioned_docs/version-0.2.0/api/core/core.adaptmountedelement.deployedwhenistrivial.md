## AdaptMountedElement.deployedWhenIsTrivial property

True if the Element's `deployedWhen` is considered trivial.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly deployedWhenIsTrivial: boolean;
```

## Remarks

This flag is a hint for user interfaces, such as the Adapt CLI. It tells the user interface that this Element's `deployedWhen` function is "trivial" and therefore its status should not typically be shown in user interfaces unless the user has requested more detailed status information on all components, or if there's an active action for the component.

This flag is `true` if the component does not have a custom `deployedWhen` method or if the trivial flag was specifically set via [useDeployedWhen()](./core.usedeployedwhen.md) options (function component) or via [Component.deployedWhenIsTrivial](./core.component.deployedwhenistrivial.md) (class component).
