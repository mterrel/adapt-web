## Component.deployedWhenIsTrivial property

A derived component can set this flag to `true` to indicate to user interfaces that this component's status should not typically be shown to the user, unless requested.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
deployedWhenIsTrivial?: boolean;
```

## Remarks

This flag is a hint for user interfaces, such as the Adapt CLI. It tells the user interface that this Element's `deployedWhen` function is "trivial" and therefore its status should not typically be shown in user interfaces unless the user has requested more detailed status information on all components, or if there's an active action for this component.
