## useDeployedWhen() function

Hook for adding a custom `deployedWhen` method to a function component.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function useDeployedWhen(deployedWhen: DeployedWhenMethod, options?: UseDeployedWhenOptions): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  deployedWhen | <code>DeployedWhenMethod</code> |  |
|  options | [<code>UseDeployedWhenOptions</code>](./core.usedeployedwhenoptions.md) |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

`void`

## Remarks

Adding a custom `deployedWhen` method to a component allows the component to directly control when the component can be considered deployed.

For more information on using `deployedWhen` methods, see [Adapt.DeployedWhenMethod](./core.adapt.deployedwhenmethod.md)<!-- -->.

For components that do not add a custom `deployedWhen` method, the default behavior is that a component becomes deployed when all of it's successors and children have been deployed. See [defaultDeployedWhen()](./core.defaultdeployedwhen.md) for more information.
